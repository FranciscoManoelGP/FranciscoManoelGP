# Hello, I'm Francisco Manoel! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student currently pursuing a *Licenciatura* degree, which prepares me to be a teacher while improving my important interpersonal communication skills.

## About Me

I have a natural curiosity and a strong desire to study new technologies. I've already had hands-on experience with both frontend and backend development. My passion lies in web development, where I'm focusing on:

- JavaScript: I enjoy building interactive and dynamic user interfaces using JavaScript.
- Node.js: I'm proficient in server-side development using Node.js, allowing me to create scalable and efficient web applications.
- SvelteKit: I'm currently exploring SvelteKit, an exciting reactive framework for building fast and efficient web applications.

## Get in Touch

I'm always eager to discuss web development and collaborate on interesting projects. If you have any questions, ideas, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out.
