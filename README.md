# Hello, I'm Francisco Manoel! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student currently pursuing a *Licenciatura* degree, which prepares me to be a teacher while improving my important interpersonal communication skills.

- JavaScript: I enjoy building interactive and dynamic user interfaces using JavaScript.
- Node.js: I'm proficient in server-side development using Node.js, allowing me to create scalable and efficient web applications.
- SvelteKit: I'm currently exploring SvelteKit, an exciting reactive framework for building fast and efficient web applications.
